# Object Tracking Models in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of three popular object tracking models: Harrcascase, YOLOv3, and Hungarian. These models are commonly used in computer vision applications to track objects within a video stream or series of images.

## Models

### 1. Harrcascase Model

The Harrcascase model is a classic object detection and tracking algorithm. It uses Haar-like features and cascades of classifiers to identify and track objects. This model is known for its simplicity and efficiency.

- Implementation: [Link to Harrcascase Java code](/javaTrack_Harrcascase/)
- Usage: Detailed usage instructions for the Harrcascase model can be found in the `javaTrack_Harrcascase/README.md` file.

### 2. YOLOv3 Model

YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection and tracking model. It divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. YOLOv3 is known for its accuracy and speed.

- Implementation: [Link to YOLOv3 Java code](/javaTrack_Yolo/)
- Usage: Detailed usage instructions for the YOLOv3 model can be found in the `javaTrack_Harrcascase/README.md` file.

### 3. Hungarian Model

The Hungarian model, also known as the Hungarian algorithm, is a combinatorial optimization technique used for solving the assignment problem. In the context of object tracking, it can be used to assign tracked objects to their corresponding identities in consecutive frames.

- Implementation: [Link to Hungarian Java code](/javaTrack_Hungarian/)
- Usage: Detailed usage instructions for the Hungarian model can be found in the `javaTrack_Harrcascase/README.md` file.

## Getting Started

To use these object tracking models in your Java project, follow the instructions provided in each model's respective README file. You may need to install additional dependencies, provide trained models, or specify input and output configurations based on your specific use case.
